# Data-Science-Learning
This repository is intended to store knowledge about data science.
The main idea is to store some methods an techniques that I have used in my work or in other projects.
right now I don't have anything but this, in the future (I expect) will be filled with some methods and their codes.

I use mainly R and Python but I want to start using Julia. 
Given that the data of my projects is private I will use mainly simulated data or the tipical data set that every data scientist knows (iris for example.)

With the time will make also a spanish version of this repository
